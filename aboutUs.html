                <p>We are Kunal and Roshni, a brother - sister duo who are the owners of the company called The Handmade Store.

                    It all started in 2018 when we came up with a specific goal.
                    The goal to empower local artisans and craftswomen in India, specifically women who make handmade jewellery, handmade rugs, home decor items and accessories.
                    
                    Handmade art has the power to be a small thing that can make you feel unique, and these women have the power to make you feel that.
                    
                    We wanted to make amazing and lasting art accessible to everyone, so it slowly has grown into a global business.
                    
                    We are more than happy to share that our company currently provides employment to over 100+ women in villages in Rajasthan.
                    
                    Since the pandemic started, many women in India have lost their jobs. Handmade Store is one of the opportunity for them to not only provide for the family, but also express themselves and delight us with their art.
                    
                    We cut out the middleman and sell the products at 50% below retail price so that everyone can buy and enjoy these pieces of art!
                    
                    When you buy items from The Handmade Store, it not only means you are buying a unique product, but also the product that was made with love and care.
                    Feel special and elegant. Crafted passionately all the way to your heart.
